Problem Description
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks. You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Input format
The first line contains an integer N, the size of the input array. The second line contains N integers, the elements of the given array.

Output format
Return a single integer, the index of the peak element in the array (0-based).

Sample Input 1
4

1 2 3 1

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation
3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Constraints
1 <= nums.length <= 1000

1 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1

nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i
